		<p>We are a group of four undergraduate female students in computer science who are currently partaking in the AI4SocialGood Lab at McGill University. Throughout the first 2 weeks of the lab, we learned about AI and machine learning techniques and are now applying this knowledge to solve a social problem. Based on personal experience, we felt that there weren't enough technology out there to help non-blind people interact and communicate with blind people. So we decided to create a braille-to-text-converter that is able to take an image of a line (a word, sentence, or a character) of Braille, recognize it, and output its English counterpart. Using data acquired from rare book collections and the internet, we contructed our own dataset consisting of multiple sets of the Braille alphabet, numbers, and symbols. We then trained an AI that will recognize images of individual Braille characters and translate them into English characters. Using a specific ratio and cropping function, we are able to take an image of a sentence/line of Braille and segment each Braille character out individually. We feed each of these characters into our model and then concatenate the output characters together into an English sentence or word. The main objective of this project is to bring awareness of Braille and to bridge the gap of communication between blind and non-blind people.</p>

		<p>Our braille-to-text-converter started off as a project for the AI4SocialGood Hackathon 2018 hosted at Desjardins Lab. Because we didn't have time to complete most of our goals for the project during the 24hrs duration of the hackathon, we decided to continue the project as our final project for the AI4SocialGood Lab that we are all participating in.</p>

		<p>We've been working hard on our project for the past 3 weeks! We were able to accomplish all of our goals for the project and we hope this project will be of use at some point in your life, especially if someone you know is blind and uses Braille to read!</p>
